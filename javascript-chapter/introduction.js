/*programmingLanguages :
it is a way to communicate with computers and create software applications.
programing is a set of precise intructions that a computer can understand and execute.
programming languages are used to write programs that can perform various tasks, such as data processing, web development, game development, and more.
 
ECMA Script:
ECMA Script is a standard for scripting languages, and JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages that follows this standard.
JS & ECMA Script are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing.
JS IS VERY libral and flexible, allowing developers to write code in various styles, while ECMA Script provides a more structured and standardized approach to writing JavaScript code.

JavaScript:
js can be executed in few different ways:
1. In a web browser: JavaScript code can be embedded in HTML pages and executed by the browser when the page is loaded.
2. on runtime like node.js which can be installed and used to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. its done by ryan dahl in 2009.
3. it inside <script> tag in HTML files, which allows developers to write JavaScript code directly within the HTML document.

What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that is mostly used to control the behavior of web pages. It helps web pages respond to user actions, like clicking buttons, filling forms, or moving the mouse.
Without JavaScript, web pages would just sit there, showing information without reacting to anything. With JavaScript, they become interactive and fun to use.

 Role of JavaScript in Web Development
There are 3 main parts of a webpage:
1.	HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – this gives structure to a page (like the text, images, and headings).
2.	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – this adds style (colors, fonts, layout).
3.	JavaScript – this adds behavior and interaction.
Together, they create modern websites.

 What Can JavaScript Do?
JavaScript can:
•	Show or hide content without reloading the page
•	Validate form inputs (e.g., check if a field is empty)
•	Create image sliders, dropdown menus, or pop-up messages
•	Load new data from the internet without refreshing the page (this is called AJAX)
•	Build full web applications (like online games, calculators, or shopping carts)

 Where Does JavaScript Run?
JavaScript runs directly in the browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge). Every modern browser has a built-in JavaScript engine that understands and executes JavaScript code.
How Does JavaScript Work?
1.	When you open a webpage, your browser loads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2.	The JavaScript tells the browser what to do when certain things happen (like a click).
3.	The browser then follows those instructions and updates the page without needing to reload.
Uses Beyond the Browser
Although JavaScript started as a language for the web, now it's used in many other places:
•	Mobile apps (using tools like React Native)
•	Server-side programming (using Node.js)
•	Game development
•	Desktop applications

Features of JavaScript
•	Lightweight – Runs quickly in the browser.
•	Dynamic – Can change content on the fly.
•	Flexible – Works with HTML and CSS easily.
•	Object-oriented – Works with "objects" like buttons, text fields, and more.
•	Event-driven – Reacts to events like clicks, typing, or hovering.

 Summary
•	JavaScript is a language that makes websites interactive.
•	It works inside web browsers.
•	It helps with things like button clicks, form validation, and showing/hiding content.
•	It’s one of the most important languages for building websites.
